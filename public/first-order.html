		<h2 id="section_fomaml">First-Order MAML (FOMAML)</h2>
		<p>
			FOMAML was suggested by Finn et al. (the authors of MAML, in the very paper that introduces MAML) and
			is a straightforward heuristic to get rid of
			the second-order terms (which we introduced on
			<a href="variants-intro.html#start">the last page</a>):
			Setting them to zero! As a result

			\[\nabla_\theta U_{\tau_i}(\theta) = I\]

			and the overall meta loss gradient reduces to

			\[ \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i} \nabla_{U_{\tau_i}(\theta)} \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i,
			\text{test}} (U_{\tau_i}(\theta))
			.\]

			Simple right? Maybe a bit too simple. Let us have a detailed look at the term we are discarding, namely

			\[ \nabla^2_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}(\theta). \]

			This term is known as the <i>Hessian</i> of loss function \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}\), which
			describes the local curvature as a function <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/ParkO19"></d-cite>. Further, setting it to zero results in a linear
			approximation of the meta-gradient,
			being more accurate the more locally linear the meta-gradient is at meta-parameter \(\theta\).
			To see what the Hessian actually entails, let us resolve it under the assumption of
			<i>MSE</i> loss, neural net \(M\) and dataset \(\mathcal{D} := (x, y)\). We omit some of the subscripts to
			make the formulae more readable and write

			\[ \nabla^2 \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \nabla^2 \frac{1}{2} (y - M(x; \theta)^T(y - M(x; \theta)) \]

			\[ = \nabla M(x; \theta)\nabla M(x; \theta)^T -(y - M(x; \theta))^T \nabla^2 M(x; \theta). \]

			So the only second-order term in the Hessian of the loss function is the Hessian of the neural net \(M\).
			While there is empirical evidence of the local curvature
			of neural nets being near zero <b>after training</b> (and near-zero local curvature would easily
			justify dropping the Hessian in the MAML meta-update altogether), the same study also indicates that this is
			not necessarily the case
			for randomly initialized weights <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/corr/SagunBL16"></d-cite>. On the other hand, the authors of MAML hypothesize that
			the often by design nearly linear nature of neural nets (especially the ones with ReLU layers that they
			use - see ReLUs <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/jmlr/GlorotBB11"></d-cite>),
			might explain the success of FOMAML, since nearly linear functions have nearly zero Hessians.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you compare, e.g., Table 1 in the MAML paper, you will find that FOMAML easily keeps
			up with its second-order counterpart
			in terms of classification performance. So depending on your personal taste in theoretical rigor, this
			explanation might be more or less
			satisfactory.
			If you are nonetheless interested in how local curvature affects a function space, take a look at the <a
				href="#curvatureDemo">following figure</a>. Here we prepared a very simple function space, namely the
			space of

			\[ f(x) := \frac{1}{2} (x - \frac{1}{2})^T C (x - \frac{1}{2}) + g^T x, \]

			with Hessian \(C \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}\), constant \(g \in \mathbb{R}^2\), and gradient \(C(x - \frac{1}{2}) + g\), where we assume that
			\(C\) is a symmetric matrix, i.e. that it has the form

			\[ C = \begin{bmatrix}
			a & b \\ b & c
			\end{bmatrix}. \]

			Changing \(a, b, c \) lets you observe the effect of curvature on the form of the function space.
			As you should be able to verify, non-zero values for the Hessian curve the space and the more curvature we introduce, the
			poorer the first-order approximation \(\nabla f_{C=0}(x) \) to the
			gradient becomes.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="curvatureDemo"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Hopefully, you have gained some understanding of how FOMAML works and what effect second-order terms
			(encoding local curvature) can have on the loss space,
			as well as arguments for and against linear approximations of the meta-gradient.

		</p>
		<p>
			FOMAML and the fact that it can compete so easily with MAML tells us that the information necessary to
			learn across tasks is
			contained, for the most part, not in any Hessian, but within the first order parts of the meta-gradient. Following
			up on this narrative, we
			will next study <a href="reptile.html#start">Reptile</a>, another prominent first-order method, with a slightly different approach.
