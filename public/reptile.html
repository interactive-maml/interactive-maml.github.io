		<h2 id="h2-reptile">Reptile</h2>
		<p>
			Reptile, proposed by Nichol et al. <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1803-02999"></d-cite>, is another
			first-order version of MAML that uses a simple update
			procedure to find the
			optimal initialization \(\theta\). Let's have a look:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Sample task \(\tau_i\) from \(p(\tau)\)</li>
			<li>2. Compute \(\phi_i := U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\), where \(U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\) is a gradient-based optimizer
				with \(k > 1\) gradient
				descent steps.
			</li>
			<li>3. Update \(\theta\) according to \(\theta = \theta + \beta(\phi_i - \theta)\).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note the two most noticeable differences to MAML:
			First of all, we only sample one task at a time. This is more
			similar to the training of the <i>pretrained</i>
			model than to MAML. Remember that in MAML, we minimize the expected meta-loss over several sampled tasks.
			Secondly, it seems like we
			are not computing a meta-gradient at all, more like a difference of parameters. And in fact, the formula we
			use for
			updating \(\theta\),

			\[ \theta = \theta + \beta(\phi_i - \theta), \]

			is the formula for linear interpolation between \( \theta \) and \( \phi_i \), with interpolation rate
			\(\beta
			\in [0, 1]\).
			If you are not sure what that means in the context of parameter optimization, take a look at <a
				href="#reptileInterpolation">this figure</a>. There
			you
			can play around with the
			position of \(\theta\), the optimizer \(U_{\tau_i}\) and the interpolation rate \(\beta\) and see
			how Reptile would calculate the update of \( \theta \).
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="reptileInterpolation"></d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			One detail of Reptile is not apparent just from looking at the three steps,
			but is still important to note:
			Reptile does not (need to) differentiate between test- and training-sets when computing loss
			\(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i}\) since
			it does not update according to test-set-performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, it makes sense to spend some time studying why the authors of Reptile explicitly state that
			optimizer \(U_{\tau_i}\) must perform
			more than one gradient descent step (\(k > 1\)). This is because otherwise

			\[ U_{\tau_i}(\theta) = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta L_{\tau_i}(\theta) \]

			and Reptile updates

			\[ \theta = \theta + \beta (\theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta L_{\tau_i}(\theta) - \theta)
			= \theta - \alpha \beta \nabla_\theta L_{\tau_i}(\theta), \]

			which corresponds to updating \(\theta \) according to standard gradient descent with learning rate \(\alpha
			\cdot \beta\).
			And this, in turn, is more or less the update scheme we used for the <i>pretrained</i> model, which we have
			already seen failing.
		</p>
		<p>
			You might have already figured this out yourself ff you set the inner steps of <a
				href="#reptileInterpolation">the figure from above</a>
			to \(1\) (which were set to \(2\) by default deliberately - and now you know why).

			However, it should also be noted, as stated in <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1803-02999"></d-cite>, that as soon as \(k > 1\), the update step
			cannot be reduced to simple gradient descent anymore since
			it involves terms accounting for meta-performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, at this point, you might have already understood <i>how</i> the Reptile update works, but no idea
			<i>if</i> and <i>why</i> it would
			find the same optimal initialization that MAML does! As for the <i>if</i>, Reptile does not (always) find
			the same optimal initialization
			that MAML would find since Reptile does not minimize the same objective. However, Reptile performs
			competitively well compared to MAML in several few-shot learning
			problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			As for the <i>why</i>, let us revisit the update step of Reptile, which we called <i>linear
				interpolation</i>:

			\[ \theta = \theta + \beta(\phi_i - \theta). \]

			This formula is also known as the update rule, with which one computes an <i>exponential moving
				average</i>. Starting with
			a current estimate for the empirical mean of a distribution \(theta\), we update our belief based on a new
			observation
			\(\phi_i\) and discount the update such that we trade-off between our confidence in our previous belief and
			the new observation
			being close to the true mean.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hence, we can interpret Reptile as computing an estimate of the average optimal parameter of each task.
			This confirms what we
			already discovered with FOMAML: The information important for learning across tasks is contained
			not within one task (i.e., pretrained approach),
			and for the most part, not in higher-order derivatives (MAML) but within optimizing on a task with respect to
			the initial parameters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next up is <a href="imaml.html">iMAML</a>, which changes the narrative and introduces us to yet another approach
			to bypass second-order gradients.
