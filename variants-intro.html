		<h2>Why differentiating through an optimizer is actually as complicated as it sounds</h2>
		<p>
			In this section, we want to gain some understanding of what it actually means to differentiate through fine-tuning function \(U_\tau\).
			Recall the gradient that MAML requires us to compute:

			\[ \nabla_\theta\, \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\tau \left[\, \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi)
			\,\right]
			.\]

			Expanding the inner term by applying the chain rule yields

			\[ \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi) = \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(U_{\tau}(\theta)) = \nabla_{U_{\tau}(\theta)} \mathcal{L}_{\tau,
			\text{test}}
			\nabla_\theta U_{\tau}(\theta) .\]

			Here, \( \nabla_{U_{\tau}(\theta)}\, \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}} \) represents the gradient of the
			loss of task
			\(\tau\) by the optimized parameter \(\phi\)
			and \(\nabla_\theta U_{\tau}(\theta)\) is a gradient through an optimization algorithm.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if we assume that the optimizer takes only one gradient descent step, this term becomes

			\[ \nabla_\theta U_{\tau}(\theta) = \nabla_\theta (\theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{train}}(\theta) ) = I - \alpha \nabla^2_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{train}}(\theta). \]

			Hence, MAML requires us to compute second derivatives in order to optimize \(\theta\), which is
			computationally inefficient, especially
			in high-dimensional problems (such as learning neural nets).
		</p>
		<p>
			If we don't restrict ourselves to making just a single gradient update,
			the term becomes slightly more complicated. Let \(k\) be the number of updates
			we make and
			\( \phi^i \) describe the \(i\)th step of gradient descent, then:

			$$\begin{align}
			\nabla_\theta \phi^k &= \frac{\mathrm d\phi^k}{\mathrm d\theta}
			= \prod_{i=1}^{k} \frac{\mathrm d\phi^i}{\mathrm d\phi^{k-1} }\\
			&= \prod^{k}_{i=1} \left(
				I - \alpha \nabla^2_{\phi^{i-1}}\mathcal L_{\tau,\text{train}}(\phi^{i-1})
			\right)
			\end{align}$$
		</p>

		<p>
			There are two prevalent methods of calculating the meta-gradient.
			Both methods have their unique limitations which we will discuss shortly.
		</p>

		<h3>Calculating the Jacobians for every update step</h3>
		<p>
			The most straightforward approach is to calculate the Jacobian in each update
			step. Considering the product from above, we can iteratively multiply 
			the new Jacobian term with the accumulated Jacobian matrix, ending up with the full optimizer Jacobian after 
			\(k\) update steps.
		</p>
		<p>
			The big issue with Jacobian matrices, however, is that they are huge! For deep neural
			networks it is not uncommon to have paramters in the magnitude of millions.
			Even though we may not need to store the complete square matrix and can
			potentially sparsify it, the resulting number of required entries
			for a large model will still be enormous.
			This places a huge burden on the computational and memory resources.
			One advantage is, that the required memory only depends on the model size,
			but not on the number of update steps.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find out how one can get around calculating any second order derivatives,
			take a look at <a href="first-order.html#start">FOMAML</a>
			and <a href="reptile.html#start">REPTILE</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Calculating the Hessian vector product directly</h3>
		<p>
			In order to circumvent the need for calculating and storing a Jacobian
			matrix. If you take a step back and look at what we ultimately want to calculate,
			we recognize that we are not really interested in the Jacobian, but in a
			product of the Jacobian (first) with a gradient vector (second factor):

			\[ \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi) =
			\left(
				\frac{\mathrm d  U_{\tau}(\theta)}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\left(
				\nabla_{U_{\tau}(\theta)} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}
			\right)
			.\]
		</p>

		<p>
			The fact that we are not looking for the matrix itself, but only the product
			can be cleverly exploited. One key ingredient is a function which we will call
			\( \mathrm {sg} \) for "stop gradient". This function is actually very simple
			(in the implementation as well as its properties): It returns the same
			value which we input, but it stops the flow of the gradient during backpropagation.
			In tensorflow this function is implemented in <code>tf.stop_gradient()</code>
			while in py-torch one can use the <code>.detach()</code> function on a tensor
			to produce the same effect. As a result of the stop-gradient-operation, each time we evaluate a gradient of
			\(\mathrm{sg}(y)\) with respect to any variable \(x\), we assume
			\[
				\frac{\mathrm d\, \mathrm {sg}(y)}{\mathrm dx} = 0
			.\]

			This allows us to write the Jacobian as:

			\[
			\begin{align}
			\nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi) &=
			\left(
				\frac{\mathrm d  \phi}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\mathrm{sg} \left(
				\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}
			\right)\\
			&=
			\left(
				\frac{\mathrm d  \phi}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\mathrm{sg} \left(
				\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}
			\right)
			+
			\left(
				\frac{\mathrm d\,  \mathrm{sg} \left(
					\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}
				\right)}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\phi
			\\
			&=
			\frac{\mathrm {d}}{\mathrm {d} \theta}
			\left(
			\phi\, \cdot
			\mathrm{sg} \left(\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}\right)
			\right)
			.
			\end{align}\]

		</p>
		<p>
			What we essentially do, is to store the computational graph of our optimization
			procedure and then backpropagate the dot product of the gradient on the test
			loss (treating it as a constant) and the task parameter which the
			optimizer produced. By subtracting this derivative (which is the meta gradient)
			from the current meta-parameter (i.e., doing gradient descent),
			we move the task-parameter in a direction to better align it with the
			gradient on the test loss.
			If the two vectors (test loss gradient  and task-parameter) are disaligned
			(i.e., the task-parameter is aligned with the negative test loss gradient)
			then moving into the the direction of the negative gradient will further
			minimize the dot product. Hence, minimizing the dot product and
			minimizing the test loss is actually equivalent when doing gradient
			descent.
		</p>

		<p>
			While this approach does not require to store or calculate Jacobian matrices,
			it also comes with a downside:
			Calculating the derivative of the dot product requires backpropagating
			through the whole optimization chain. Since we need to backpropagate
			through it at the end, we need to store the complete computaional graph
			and can't employ an iterative calculation as with the Jacobian matrices.
			The memory burden of this increases linearly with the number of updates
			the optimizer takes. It should also be mentioned that while this approach
			does not require the calculation of Jacobians, it does require second
			order derivatives.

			graph of the optimization prodedure, take a look at
