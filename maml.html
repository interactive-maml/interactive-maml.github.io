		<h2 id="few_shot_maml">How MAML works</h2>
		<p>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a meta-learning approach to solve different tasks from simple
			regression to reinforcement learning but also few-shot learning. <d-cite
				bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.
			To learn more about it, let us build an example from the ground up and then try to apply MAML.
			We will do this by alternating mathematical walk-throughs and interactive, as well as coding examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have applied machine learning
			before, you have probably already solved or attempted to solve a problem like the following:
			Training a model to solve one specific task, for example, to classify cats from dogs or to
			teach an agent
			to find its way through a maze. In these settings, if we are able to define a loss
			\(\mathcal{L}_\tau:\ \Phi \equiv \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R\) for our task \(\tau\), which depends on
			the parameters
			\(\phi \in \Phi\) of a model, we can express our learning objective as

			\[ \underset{\phi}{\text{min}} \, \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) .\]

			We usually find the optimal \(\phi\) by progressively walking in the opposite direction of the gradient of
			\(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) with respect to \(\phi\), i.e.,

			\[ \phi \leftarrow \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}_\tau (\phi) ,\]

			also known as gradient descent. \(\mathcal{L}_\tau\) usually also depends on some data, and \(\alpha\)
			is the learning rate,
			controlling the size of the steps we want to take.
		</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, applying this to regression or a few-shot task (i.e., with a very small dataset), the
			above method is
			known to perform poorly on, e.g., neural networks, since there is simply too little data for too many
			parameters, leading to overfitting.

			The key idea of MAML is to
			mitigate this problem by learning not only from the data regarding exactly our task but also from
			data of similar tasks.
			To incorporate this, we make an additional assumption, namely that \(\tau\) comes from some distribution of
			tasks \(p(\tau)\) and that we
			can sample freely from this distribution. Eventually we want to use the data available from the other tasks
			in
			the distribution to be able to converge to a specific task \(\tau_i \sim p(\tau)\), which we can express in
			terms of an
			expectation over the distribution.

			\(\tau\) is now a random variable and \(\phi_\tau\) is a set of
			parameters for task \(\tau\). We may use different parameters for each
			task, use the same parameters for every task, or do something in between.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, we will not simply use the data from other tasks to find parameters that
			are optimal for all
			tasks, but keep the option to <i>fine-tune</i> our model, i.e., take additional optimizer steps on data from
			the new task \(\tau_i\).
			Afterward, we want to have converged to \(\tau_i\) and reuse the pre-fine-tune-version of the model for each
			new task. Thus, we
			can express our optimization objective as

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (U_\tau(\theta)) ] ,\]

			where \(U_\tau: \Phi \rightarrow \Phi \) is an optimization algorithm that maps \(\theta\) to a new
			parameter vector \( U_\tau(\theta) \), being the result of fine-tuning \(\theta\) on data from task
			\(\tau\), using optimizer \(U_\tau\).
			For the rest of this article, we assume \(U_\tau\) corresponds to
			performing gradient descent with a variable number of steps but don't let this limit your imagination of
			what
			algorithm \(U_\tau\) could be.
		</p>
		<p>
			A word on terminology: In conventional machine learning settings, we consider
			trainable parameters
			that are tied to our task. However, the \(\theta\) in the above objective is learned with respect to a
			variety of tasks. This together with the fact, that
			it can further be regarded as the <i>initialization</i> of the optimizer \(U_\tau\), lets us interpret
			\(\theta\) to be above
			task-level and thus acquires the status of a <i>meta-parameter</i>. Consequently, optimizing such a
			meta-parameter corresponds to
			<i>meta-learning</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having set the above objective, we are already halfway there. The only thing that is left is to find a
			feasible
			optimizer
			for \(\theta\). Before we jump into how MAML solves this problem, we are going to take a look at a simple
			baseline, which will help us
			to digest the setting a bit better and which leads us directly to MAML.
		</p>
		<h3>Part 1: A simple baseline</h3>
		<p>Recalling our optimization objective

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (U_\tau(\theta)) ] ,\]

			the following approach mitigates dealing with \(U_\tau\), mostly by ignoring it exists, which would make the
			objective
			collapse to

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (\theta) ] ,\]

			i.e., the standard machine learning setting that we have already talked about. However this time,
			we are not operating on a few samples of one task but
			have a whole distribution
			of tasks at our disposal.
			Hence, we can reliably solve the
			simplified objective with gradient descent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Omitting the update procedure \(U_\tau\),
			we expect the final \(\theta\) to be chosen such that fine-tuning the model
			on only a few samples of some task \(\tau_i\) from the distribution
			makes the model parameters close to optimal.
			This hope might seem naive,
			considering that we did not reason about why \(U_\tau\) might be disregarded, but simply disregarded it. But
			on the other hand, this part
			is not called "a simple baseline" for no reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			Expectations are commonly approximated by an empirical mean over samples from the respective distribution,
			also known as <i>Expected Risk Minimization (ERM)</i>.
			If we apply this here, the resulting gradient is also the empirical mean of the
			task gradients (\(n\) is the number of sampled tasks):

			\[ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \frac{\alpha}{n} \nabla_\theta \sum_i \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i} (\theta) .\]
		</p>
		<p>
			Finn et al.<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>, the authors of MAML, call this type of
			baseline the <i>pretrained</i> model:
			we can simply pretrain over all available data and defer the problem of dealing with \(U_\tau\). Now, we can
			make use of the pretrained model
			by simply fine-tuning the final \(\theta\), the result of our pretraining, on a new task - which is exactly
			what we will do a bit further down!
		</p>
		<p>
			Moving on, we will take a little detour and talk about some
			implementational aspects of the pretrained baseline.
			It will also serve us as a starting point to later implement MAML. Afterward,
			you can <i>watch the pretrained model fail</i> in as small experiment we prepared.

		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the Pretrained Model</h4>
		<p>
			If the above got all too theoretical for you, take a look at the following <i>gist</i>. It contains a
			simplistic
			implementation of an update step
			for the <i>pretrained</i> model in TensorFlow
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/corr/AbadiABBCCCDDDG16"></d-cite>, a popular machine
			learning library. The implementation
			tries to emphasize
			that
			even if we differentiate between tasks when sampling the batch, the actual optimizer treats each sample the
			same.
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/cf31417164bc5513302788b906d2a3c2.js"></script>
		<p>
			The implementation is agnostic to the choice of the optimizer. We use the <i>Adam</i> optimizer to be
			congruent
			with the original paper<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.
		</p>
		<h4 id="pretrained-model-on-a-sinusoid-problem">Pretrained Model on a Sinusoid Problem (Regression)</h4>
		<p>
			In the following figure, you can experiment with a <i>pretrained</i> model trained by a collection
			of sinusoid regression tasks.
			The task distribution works as follows: Each task is represented by an amplitude
			\(A\) and a
			phase \(\varphi\) and requires the prediction of sinusoid \(f\):

			\[ f(x) := A \sin(x + \varphi),\]

			where \(A, \varphi\) are sampled uniformly from some predefined range.

			Different parameters yield different functions, \(f_1\) and \(f_2\), with possibly completely
			different function values and gradients.
			Take, for example, the following two tasks:
			Tasks \(\tau_1, \tau_2\) are both regression tasks on sinusoids \(f_1(x) := \sin (x - \frac{\pi}{2})\) and
			\(f_2(x) := \sin (x + \frac{\pi}{2})\) respectively. These two tasks' function values give completely
			contradicting information, as

			\[ f_1(x) = - f_2(x). \]
		</p>
		<p>
			Before fitting the model, what do you expect to happen based on the position and the
			number of samples provided? Feel free to also experiment with the different settings: distributing the
			samples equispaced or squeezing all of them to a small range
			of the x-axis.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="fitSinePretrained">
				<div class="element is-loading" style="height: 400px"></div>
			</d-figure>
		</figure>

		<p>Ouch! That does not seem to work that well. Maybe you have already guessed that it would have been too easy.
			Remember our interpretation of what happens when omitting \(U_\tau\)? We said that we expect the \(\theta\)
			that minimizes
			the simplified objective can be fine-tuned easily into any task from the distribution. But it seems, such a
			\(\theta\) is either impossible or at the very least incredibly difficult to find. Subsequently, we will try
			to gain some insight into the difficulties of the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us recall the original optimization objective, i.e.,

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (U_\tau(\theta)) ] .\]

			We can augment this notation by giving \(U_\tau\) a superscript, i.e., write \(U^{(m)}_\tau\), indicating
			that we
			perform \(m\) steps of gradient descent. Then we recover the simplified objective of the pretrained model by
			setting \(m = 0\), as

			\[ U^{(0)}_\tau(\theta) = \theta .\]

			It should be emphasized that \(m = 0\) is not simply one of many special cases of our few-shot learning
			objective but rather indicates <i>no fine-tuning</i>, which is clearly not what we intended.

			We have already seen that for \(m =0\) the loss space with respect to
			some task samples becomes

			\[ \sum_i \mathcal{L}_\tau (\theta) ,\]

			i.e., a simple sum of loss spaces. From now on, we have to carefully distinguish
			between the <i>task loss spaces</i>
			which are defined by the individual \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_1}\), ..., \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_n}\) for tasks
			\(\tau_1\), ..., \(\tau_n\) and
			the <i>accumulated loss space</i>, defined by

			\[ \sum_i \mathcal{L}_\tau (U^{(m)}_\tau(\theta)) .\]
		</p>
		<p>
			The following figure explores this representation visually by letting you
			control \(m\) to see how the resulting loss space changes. As we increase \(m\), the loss space and with it
			the position of the minimum
			change, indicating that the simplified objective of the pretrained model can be a poor approximation to the
			few-shot-meta-learning objective, we
			would actually like to solve.
		</p>

				<div class="element is-loading" style="height: 400px"></div>
			</d-figure>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Having established the problems arising from omitting the fine-tuning function \(U_\tau\) from
			the optimization objective, we will finally turn to MAML. MAML does not disregard \(U_\tau\) but rather
			optimizes
			through it.
			In the next part, we will see how that goes about.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning</h3>
		<p>
			We will now study MAML in detail, trying to optimize the previously established few-shot learning objective

			\[ \underset{\theta}{\text{min}} \, \mathbb{E}_\tau [ \mathcal{L}_\tau (U^{(m)}_\tau(\theta)) ] ,\]

			for \(m > 0\). In short, MAML optimizes the same \(\theta\) as the pretrained model, but in its optimization
			strategy, it
			acknowledges the effect of fine-tuning function \(U_\tau\) on the accumulated loss space.
		</p>
		<h4>Outline of the Algorithm</h4>
		<p>
			Let us jump right in and take a look at the three main steps of the method,
			given a (current)
			meta-parameter \(\theta\) :
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Sample a number of tasks \(\tau_i\) from \(p(\tau)\).</li>
			<li>2. For each task obtain \(\phi_i = U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\), by minimizing \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i,
				\text{train}}(\theta)\)
				on a few training samples.</li>
			<li>3. Update \(\theta\) by gradient descent such that it minimizes \(\mathcal{L}(\theta) := \sum_i
				\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i)\) on a few
				test samples.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note, that \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}\)
			are two instances of the same loss function
			on the same task \( \tau_i \) and correspond to training or test data from
			this task (though \( \tau_i \) changes while iterating over \(i \) ).
			The easiest way to obtain \(\phi_i\), is to do a single step of gradient
			descent (\( \phi_i \) will not be optimal but most likely better then \( \theta \) ):

			\[ \phi_i = \theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{train}}(\theta).\]

			Further, updating \(\theta\) requires us to evaluate the gradient of the individual task losses on a set of
			test data. We obtain
			the gradient of the overall loss as follows:

			\[ \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i} \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau_i, \text{test}}(\phi_i)
			.\]

			Note that \(\phi_i = U_{\tau_i}(\theta)\) depends on \(\theta\), which means that we have to take a gradient
			through the optimizer
			\(U\). We can then update \(\theta\) via gradient descent, using a new learning rate \(\beta\):

			\[ \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta).\]

			And that 🥁... is more or less everything that comprises the original MAML algorithm.
		</p>
		<h4>Implementing the Algorithm</h4>
		<p>
			However, a machine learning algorithm is not very useful unless we can execute it on a computer. While
			implementing the <i>pretrained</i>
			model was more or less straightforward, implementing MAML requires some more thought. Firstly, computing
			\(\phi_i\) is still straightforward; simply call
			the optimization algorithm of your choice (as long as it is gradient-based).
			However, how do we then compute the gradient through that optimization algorithm?
			It is actually not that complicated. Almost every modern machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:journals/corr/AbadiABBCCCDDDG16"></d-cite> ), can
			differentiate through
			nearly arbitrary python code. Hence, if we can express our optimizer in a python function, TensorFlow
			can differentiate through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below you find a <i>gist</i> that implements a simplistic version of the MAML update step. The
			optimizer is encoded within the function
			<i>fastWeights</i>, but the function also directly applies an input tensor to the optimized weights
			<d-footnote>The name <i>fastWeights</i> is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/cbfinn/maml">the
					original implementation of MAML</a>, a suitable name given that we obtain the adapted (temporary) model parameters 
					\(\phi_i\) as well as the corresponding test loss in one go.</d-footnote>.
			We did
			this mainly for simplicity, but if you
			are interested in thorough reasoning about this design choice, you can read more about it <a
				href="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/f23f483c405b0a169bf279f7b02209bc">in the comments under the
				gist</a>.
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/pupuis/f23f483c405b0a169bf279f7b02209bc.js"></script>
		<h4>Will it really work?</h4>

		<p>
			Before we study the MAML model on the sinusoid task distribution, let us spend some
			time on trying to see MAML in action. Consider the problem in <a href="#twoLossSpaces">figure below</a>.
			As already established, our few-shot optimization objective was to find an optimal meta-parameter
			\(\theta\), which we can easily fine-tune
			on any task with only a few respective samples. The figure shows a task distribution of two
			different tasks and
			lets you move \(\theta\) around to make sure, in the spirit of MAML, that a single-step-fine-tuning can
			result in nearly optimal parameters
			for each task, respectively. Optimizing \(\theta\) not directly on the tasks, as the pretrained model would,
			but respecting \(\theta\)'s role as
			an initialization to the fine-tuning algorithm is what makes MAML both elegant and effective.
		</p>

		<figure>
			<d-figure id="twoLossSpaces">
				<div class="element is-loading" style="height: 400px"></div>
			</d-figure>
		</figure>

		<h4>Returning to Sinusoids</h4>
		<p>
			After studying the math behind the MAML objective, as well as its intuition and implementation, it is
			time to evaluate it on the sinusoid example.
			Hopefully, MAML will produce better results
			than the pretrained model.
			You will have the opportunity to repeat the above experiments on a model that has been trained with
			MAML in <a href="#fitSineMaml">this figure</a>.
			Try to compare the optimization behavior of both the pretrained model and MAML and evaluate for yourself
			whether
			you think the MAML-trained model has found a good meta-initialization parameter \(\theta\).
		</p>
		<figure>
			<d-figure id="fitSineMaml">
				<div class="element is-loading" style="height: 400px"></div>
			</d-figure>
		</figure>
		<p>
			So as you were hopefully able to verify, MAML produces results that are way closer to the actual sinusoid,
			despite being exposed to at most five samples.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rest of this article is dedicated to introducing interesting variants of MAML. The <a
				href="variants-intro.html#start">next page</a>
			starts with a general discussion about the difficulty of obtaining the MAML-meta-gradient, which leads
			directly to <a href="first-order.html#start">FOMAML</a>, a simple
			first-order version of MAML. A slightly different first-order approach, but still in the spirit of MAML, is
			<a href="reptile.html#start">Reptile</a>,
			which obtains meta-knowledge without an explicit meta-gradient.

			Lastly, <a href="imaml.html#start">iMAML</a> approximates the meta-update by creating a dependency between
			task-loss and meta-parameter \(\theta\) and
			thereby bypasses some of the computationally more expensive parts of the original MAML.
