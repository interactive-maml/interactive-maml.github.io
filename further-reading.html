			If your thirst for knowledge is not yet satisfied, and you want to dig even
			deeper into the field of model-agnostic meta-learning, you may use
			the list below as a starting point for further explorations (this is by
			no means intended to be an exhaustive list or represent the field of model-agnostic
			meta-learning adequately).
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are more of a hands-on person, we suggest you take a look at and
			play around with the four methods we presented.

			Task-Robust Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
		</a></h4>

		<p><i>
			Liam Collins, Aryan Mokhtari, and Sanjay Shakkottai
		</i></p>

		<p>
			This paper focuses on making MAML more robust to the task-distribution.
			The meta-objective is reformulated to optimize not for the average task,
			but for the task, the model performs worst on.
		</p>

			NoRML: No-Reward Meta Learning
		</a></h4>

		<p><i>
			Yuxiang Yang, Ken Caluwaerts, Atil Iscen, Jie Tan, and Chelsea Finn
		</i></p>

		<p>
			While our introduction focuses primarily on classification and regression,
			this paper utilizes the big strength of MAML, its model-agnosticity,
			and applies the method to reinforcement learning.
		</p>

			B-SMALL: A Bayesian Neural Network approach to Sparse Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
		</a></h4>

		<p>
			<i>Anish Madan and Ranjitha Prasad</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Anish Madan and Ranjitha Prasad propose a Bayesian neural network-based MAML algorithm (B-SMALL)
			which improves the parameter footprint of the model and is supposed to decrease
			the overfitting of the training tasks.
		</p>

			iTAML: An Incremental Task-Agnostic Meta-learning Approach
		</a></h4>

		<p>
			<i>Jathushan Rajasegaran, Salman Khan, Munawar Hayat, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, and Mubarak Shah</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			The authors of this paper adapt model-agnostic meta-learning for a
			continual learning setting. One key aspect of this method is to
			keep an exemplar memory with samples from old tasks
			to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

		</p>

		<h4 class="futher-reading"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04691">
			Meta-Learning with MAML on Trees
		</a></h4>

		<p>
			<i>Jezabel R. Garcia, Federica Freddi, Feng-Ting Liao, Jamie McGowan, Tim Nieradzik, Da-shan Shiu, Ye Tian, and Alberto Bernacchia</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Meta-Learning typically relies on the assumption that instances from task
			distribution are sufficiently similar. In this approach (called TreeMAML),
			tasks are clustered in a tree structure based on tasks similarity,
			and the gradients are aggregated hierarchically.

			Meta-Learning of Neural Architectures for Few-Shot Learning.
		</a></h4>

		<p>
			<i>Thomas Elsken, Benedikt Staffler, Jan Hendrik Metzen, and Frank Hutter</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Elsken et al. propose a method of how one might train not only weights but also
			do differentiable network architecture search (based on a method called DARTS <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/iclr/LiuSY19"></d-cite>),
			in a meta&#8209;learning setting.
